# Fruit and Vegetable Classification using Deep Learning
## Overview
This repository contains a deep learning model and a Flask web application for classifying different types of fruits and vegetables from images.
## Model
The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a dataset of images of various fruits and vegetables. The model is saved in the my_model.h5 file and can be loaded and used for prediction.
## Web Application
The web application is built using Flask and allows users to upload images of fruits and vegetables for classification. The application uses the trained model to predict the class of the uploaded image and displays the result.
## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/your-username/fruit-veg-classification.git```
2. Install the required dependencies: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Run the web application: ```python app.py```
4. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to use the application
## Dataset
The dataset used to train the model is not included in this repository. However, you can create your own dataset by collecting images of different fruits and vegetables and annotating them with their corresponding class labels.
